# Usually runs on port 80

# This pattern has been roughly tested and seems to work well. It's a Beta!

# If you use this, you should be aware that:
#
# - It's a beta! Pattern overmatches slightly, meaning it not only matches youtube traffic.
#  The crossdomain-part matches small HTML documents.
# - Benchmarks show that this pattern is fast.
# - Obviously, since this is a subset of HTTP, you need to match it
#  earlier in your iptables rules than HTTP.
