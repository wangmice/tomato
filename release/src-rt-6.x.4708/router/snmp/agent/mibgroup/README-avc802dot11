AvantCom Private 802.11 MIB for MadWiFi and HostAP Drivers using NetSNMP

The AvantCom Private 802.11 MIB for NetSNMP 5.0.8 found here uses Wireless Extension information 
and driver specific /proc files to populate the AvantCom private 802.11 MIB. See 
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html for more details about 
Wireless Extensions.

Drivers vary in what funtions and data they do and do not support in terms of Wireless 
Extensions and driver /proc files, so the AVC 802.11 MIB is populated based on what the 
particular driver makes available. 

See http://hostap.epitest.fi/ for information on the HostAP driver for the 
Prism 2/2.5/3 chipsets and http://sourceforge.net/projects/madwifi/ for more 
information on the MadWiFi driver for the Atheros chipsets.

This release assumes you already have a working build for NetSNMP in place. See 
http://www.net-snmp.org/ for details about installing NetSNMP on a Linux or other
Unix oriented OS. To add AvantCom private 802.11 MIB support, unzip the files in this 
release to the following directory:

.../net-snmp-5.0.8/agent/mibgroup 

Reconfigure NetSNMP by adding the following parameter to the configuration step 
(from the .../net-snmp-5.0.8 directory):

--with-mib-modules="avc802dot11"

Your configuration command may look a bit different than mine which is:

./configure --with-cflags="-g -O0 -Dlinux" --with-mib-modules="avc802dot11"

Now rebuild NetSNMP using the make clean, make, make install commands.

That's it, assuming you already had a NetSNMP build that was responding to SNMP
requests.

Keep in mind this is a beta release and only GETs are supported at
the moment. Please send feedback about problems and/or enhancements 
to lsimmons@avantcom.com.

Always use the MIB file that comes with the release. This is an experimental
MIB and objects will move about from time to time. If there is a question
about compatiblily, compare the DEFVAL section of the avSystem.sysMIBVersion and the
value returned in the avSystem.sysExpectedMIBVersion to be certain they match.

Support for the standard 802.11 MIB can be found at:
